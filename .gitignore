# For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
# intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check in what you need to.

#  According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#  However, in case you have a legacy requirement to skip it, you can add it to .gitignore.
